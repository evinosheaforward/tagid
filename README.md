# First project for mentorship
## Relevant notebook in code/sflintroproject.ipynb
## This project was a learning experience. 
### Mistakes: unncessary code in notebook, plots are a bit cluttered, discussion is in comments and is not very good.
## Success: Very detailed plots -- could be useful in the future

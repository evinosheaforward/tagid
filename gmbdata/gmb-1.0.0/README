Groningen Meaning Bank 1.0.0
============================


Introduction
------------

The Groningen Meaning Bank (GMB) is a corpus of texts with deep
semantic annotations.

Key features:

* GMB supports deep, rather than shallow semantics, opening the way to
  empirical, data-driven approaches to computational semantics.

* GMB integrates phenomena, instead of covering single phenomena in
  isolation, providing a better handle on explaining dependencies
  between various ambiguous linguistic phenomena.

* GMB deals with texts, not isolated sentences, providing a means to
  deal with ambiguities on the sentence level that require discourse
  context for resolving them.

* GMB comprises only public-domain texts and is distributed without
  restriction, making it possible to distribute and use the resource
  without causing a major kerfuffle.

GMB is being built using a bootstrapping approach. We employ
state-of-the-art NLP tools to produce a reasonable approximation to
gold-standard annotations.  From release to release, the annotations
are corrected and refined using human annotations coming from two main
sources: experts (linguists) and non-experts (players of a game with a
purpose).

Releases are frozen snapshots. The current version is made available
via a wiki-like Web interface called GMB Explorer. If you find errors
in the annotation, you can correct them yourself and thus contribute
to the resource.

Directory Layout
----------------

GMB is partitioned into 100 parts. Each part is identified by a
two-digit number. A part contains up to 1000 documents. Within a part,
each document is identified by a four-digit number. The ID of a
document consists of the part number, followed by a slash, followed by
the document number, e.g. 00/0030.

File Formats
------------

Every document directory contains six files, all encoded in UTF-8, with
Unix-style line endings.

en.met
    Metadata about the document, such as title, data, source, genre, and
    subcorpus. The format is one key/value pair per line, in the following form:
    key: value

en.raw
    The raw text of the document. The standoff annotation (see below) refers to
    character offsets (not byte offsets) in this document.

en.tok.off
    Standoff tokenization annotation in a vertical format. It contains one token
    per line. Columns are separated by one space character. They contain,
    respectively:
    1. the character offset of the start of the token
    2. the character offset of the end of the token
    3. a token ID, consisting of the number of the token within the sentence
       (last three digits) and the number of the sentence within the text
       (all other digits)
    4. the token itself.

en.tags
    Contains the annotation of all tokens with various tags, in the vertical
    format described at
    <http://svn.ask.it.usyd.edu.au/trac/candc/wiki/IOFormats>. Columns are
    separated by tabs. They contain, respectively:
    1. the token itself
    2. a part-of-speech tag as used in the Penn Treebank
       <ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/treebank/doc/tagguide.ps.gz>
    3. a category as used in CCGBank
       <www.cis.upenn.edu/departmental/reports/CCGbankManual.pdf>
    4. a lemma
    5. a named-entity tag, currently one of
       * O (no named entity)
       * I-ART (artifact)
       * I-DAT (date)
       * I-LOC (location)
       * I-MON (money)
       * I-ORG (organization)
       * I-PCT (percentage)
       * I-TIM (time)
       * I-TTL (title)

en.der.xml
    Contains derivations (parse trees) of the sentences. The formalism used is
    Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). The XML format is preliminary, we are
    working on finalizing the format and releasing a DTD.

en.drs.xml
    Contains a Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) representing the meaning
    of the text. The formalism used is Discourse Representation Theory (DRT),
    extended to use neo-Davidsonian events with roles from VerbNet,
    presuppositions and rhetorical relations.
